# HCMS-2004 Display Driver in C

This project provides a C-based driver for the HCMS-2004 alphanumeric display. The HCMS-2004 is a high-performance, easy-to-use dot matrix display driven by on-board CMOS ICs. It is often used in various electronics applications for displaying alphanumeric characters.

## Features

1. **Device Control:** The driver provides comprehensive control over the HCMS-2004 display, allowing users to manipulate individual dots, characters, and entire lines.

2. **Character Support:** The driver includes support for a wide range of alphanumeric characters, allowing for the display of custom messages.

3. **Brightness Control:** The driver allows for the adjustment of the display's brightness level, providing flexibility in various lighting conditions.

4. **Scrolling Text:** The driver supports scrolling text, making it possible to display longer messages that exceed the display's character limit.

## Usage

This driver is designed to be easily integrated into larger C projects. It provides a simple API for controlling the HCMS-2004 display, abstracting away the lower-level details of the display's operation.

## Compatibility

This driver is written in standard C and should be compatible with any system that supports C. However, it has been primarily tested on Windows and Linux systems.
